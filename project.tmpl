---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

struct thread
  {
    /* Owned by thread.c. */
    tid_t tid;                          /* Thread identifier. */
    enum thread_status status;          /* Thread state. */
    char name[16];                      /* Name (for debugging purposes). */
    uint8_t *stack;                     /* Saved stack pointer. */
    int priority;                       /* Priority. */
    struct list_elem allelem;           /* List element for all threads list. */

    int ticks_to_sleep;               /* How many ticks to be blocked */ //CHANGED Change so assigned elsewhere

    /* Shared between thread.c and synch.c. */
    struct list_elem elem;              /* List element. */

#ifdef USERPROG
    /* Owned by userprog/process.c. */
    uint32_t *pagedir;                  /* Page directory. */
#endif

    /* Owned by thread.c. */
    unsigned magic;                     /* Detects stack overflow. */
  };

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

			    BATCH SCHEDULING
			    ================
---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

struct condition waitingToGo[2][2]; //Condition matrix for all task types
struct lock block; //used to locking the Critical Section
int currentDirection; //either 0 or 1
int slotsFree; // 0 <= slotsFree <= BUS_CAPACITY

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> C1: How does your solution guarantee that no more that 3 tasks
>> are using the bus in the same direction?

>> C2: What prevents tasks from opposite directions from using the
>> bus simultaneously?

>> C3: How does your solution grant priority to high priority tasks over
>> the waiting tasks in the same direction?

>> C4: How do you guarantee that despite having priority, high priority
>> tasks do not start using the bus while there are still still using
>> it in the oposite direction?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C6: Why did you choose this design? Did you consider other design
>> alternatives? In what ways is it superior to another design you considered?


			   SURVEY QUESTIONS (optional)
			   ===========================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters?

>> Any other comments?
